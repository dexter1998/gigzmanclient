 * of request-time search params, and it had become unreachable: premium-v2 is
 * the only surviving template (lib/templates), and `/properties` exists only
 * in the real-estate vertical, so every tenant that can reach this route
 * renders the premium-v2 page. Keeping the dead branch would have kept the
 * whole route dynamic for no one's benefit.
 */

 * server-rendering on every request after the search-param reads were removed.
 * Declaring it static is the explicit opt-in. `searchParams` is empty on the
 * server as a result — the filters read them in the browser instead.
