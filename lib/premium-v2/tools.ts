/**
 * The calculators this template actually publishes.
 *
 * There used to be two generations of these: the database-driven
 * `/calculators/{key}` set (EMI, stamp duty, rental yield) rendered in the
 * original panel UI, and the newer purpose-built tool pages. They duplicated
 * each other and sent the same intent to two different designs, so the old
 * set is retired — this list is the single source of truth for the Tools
 * menu, the /calculators index and the home page's tools section.
 *
 * Stamp duty is deliberately absent: it had no rebuilt equivalent, and the
 * rates it applied were never professionally verified for the period.
