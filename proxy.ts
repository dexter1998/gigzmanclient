/**
 * Tenant resolution for a deployment that serves many client sites.
 *
 * Next 16 renamed `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts`; the `middleware` export and the
 * edge runtime are deprecated here, so this runs on Node.
 *
 * path mode, most verticals — /{vertical}/{slug}/services       -> /services
 * path mode, realestate      — /{vertical}/{template}/{slug}/x  -> /x
 * host mode                  — clientdomain.com/services        -> /services
 *
 * Realestate carries an extra `{template}` segment (e.g. `temp-luxury-showcase`)
 * identifying which of the several real-estate landing-page templates a tenant
 * uses, since that vertical hosts more than one design direction — every other
 * vertical still has exactly one template, so it stays two-segment.
 *
 * Either way the internal route tree stays clean and the tenant travels as a
 * request header that Server Components read through `headers()`.
 *
 * This only checks that the vertical/template segments are *known* — it has no
 * database access. Whether they're correct *for that client* is asserted in
 * `lib/tenant.ts`, which already queries `clients` by slug and can compare
 * against the stored `vertical` (and, for realestate, its assigned template)
 * in the same round trip.
